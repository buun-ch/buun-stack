# ============================================================================
# k3s System Components (kube-system namespace)
# ============================================================================
# These components are managed by k3s and follow k3s design decisions.
# Manual modifications would be overwritten during k3s upgrades.

# AVD-KSV-0024: svclb-traefik uses hostPorts by design
# This is how k3s ServiceLB works - it binds to host ports 80/443
# Cannot be changed without replacing the entire ServiceLB implementation
AVD-KSV-0024

# AVD-KSV-0014: readOnlyRootFilesystem not set
# Many k3s components need write access for proper operation
# (logs, temp files, state management)
# Acceptable for trusted system components in development environment
AVD-KSV-0014

# AVD-KSV-0118: Default securityContext usage
# k3s components use default security context for compatibility
# and resource efficiency. Acceptable for development environments.
# In production, consider hardened Kubernetes distributions.
AVD-KSV-0118

# ============================================================================
# Longhorn Storage System
# ============================================================================
# Longhorn requires extensive permissions for volume management operations
# These are expected and necessary for storage orchestration

# ============================================================================
# Kubernetes RBAC Core Components
# ============================================================================
# system:kube-controller-manager needs cluster-wide permissions
# system:kube-scheduler needs cluster-wide permissions
# These are standard Kubernetes architecture requirements
