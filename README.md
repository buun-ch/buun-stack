- User federation and identity brokering

### PostgreSQL

Production-ready relational database for:

- Keycloak data storage
- Application databases
- Vector similarity search with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for AI/ML workloads

### External Secrets Operator

Kubernetes operator for syncing secrets from external systems:

- Automatically syncs secrets from Vault to Kubernetes Secrets
- Supports multiple secret backends
- Provides secure secret rotation and lifecycle management

### MinIO

S3-compatible object storage system providing:

- High-performance distributed object storage
- AWS S3 API compatibility
- Erasure coding for data protection
- Multi-tenancy support

### JupyterHub

Multi-user platform for interactive computing:

- Collaborative Jupyter notebook environment
- Integrated with Keycloak for OIDC authentication
- Persistent storage for user workspaces
- Support for multiple kernels and environments
- Vault integration for secure secrets management

See [JupyterHub Documentation](./docs/jupyterhub.md) for detailed setup and configuration.

### Metabase

Business intelligence and data visualization platform:

- Open-source analytics and dashboards
- Interactive data exploration
- PostgreSQL integration for data storage
- Automated setup with Helm
- Session management through Vault/External Secrets
- Simplified deployment (no OIDC dependency)

Installation:

```bash
just metabase::install
```

Access Metabase at `https://metabase.yourdomain.com` and complete the initial setup wizard to create an admin account.

### DataHub

Modern data catalog and metadata management platform:

- Centralized data discovery and documentation
- Data lineage tracking and impact analysis
- Schema evolution monitoring
- OIDC integration with Keycloak for secure access
- Elasticsearch-powered search and indexing
- Kafka-based real-time metadata streaming
- PostgreSQL backend for metadata storage

Installation:

```bash
just datahub::install
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Requirements:** DataHub is resource-intensive, requiring approximately **4-5GB of RAM** and 1+ CPU cores across multiple components (Elasticsearch, Kafka, Zookeeper, and DataHub services). Deployment typically takes 15-20 minutes to complete. Ensure your cluster has sufficient resources before installation.

Access DataHub at `https://datahub.yourdomain.com` and use "Sign in with SSO" to authenticate via Keycloak.

### ClickHouse

High-performance columnar OLAP database for analytics and data warehousing:

- Columnar storage for fast analytical queries
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Horizontal scaling for large datasets
- SQL interface with advanced analytics functions
- Integration with External Secrets for secure credential management
- Support for various data formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)

Installation:

```bash
just clickhouse::install
```

Access ClickHouse at `https://clickhouse.yourdomain.com` using the admin credentials stored in Vault.

### Apache Airflow

Modern workflow orchestration platform for data pipelines and task automation:

- Airflow 3 with modern SDK components and FastAPI integration
- DAG Development: Integrated with JupyterHub for seamless workflow creation and editing
- OIDC Authentication: Secure access through Keycloak integration
- Shared Storage: DAG files shared between JupyterHub and Airflow for direct editing
- Role-based Access Control: Multiple user roles (Admin, Operator, User, Viewer)
- REST API: Ful API access for programmatic DAG management

Installation:

```bash
just airflow::install
```

**JupyterHub Integration**: After installing both JupyterHub and Airflow, DAG files are automatically shared:

- Edit DAG files directly in JupyterHub: `~/airflow-dags/*.py`
- Changes appear in Airflow UI within 1-2 minutes
- Full Python development environment with syntax checking
- Template files available for quick DAG creation

**User Management**:

```bash
# Assign roles to users
just airflow::assign-role <username> <role>

# Available roles: airflow_admin, airflow_op, airflow_user, airflow_viewer
just airflow::assign-role myuser airflow_admin
```

**API Access**: Create API users for programmatic access:

```bash
just airflow::create-api-user <username> <role>
```

> **üí° Development Workflow**: Create DAGs in JupyterHub using `~/airflow-dags/dag_template.py` as a starting point. Use `.tmp` extension during development to avoid import errors, then rename to `.py` when ready.

Access Airflow at `https://airflow.yourdomain.com` and authenticate via Keycloak.

## Common Operations

### User Management

Create additional users:

```bash
just keycloak::create-user
```

Add user to group:

```bash
just keycloak::add-user-to-group <username> <group>
```

### Database Management

Create database:

```bash
just postgres::create-db <dbname>
```

Create database user:

```bash
just postgres::create-user <username>
```

Grant privileges:

```bash
just postgres::grant <dbname> <username>
```

### Secret Management

Store secrets in Vault:

```bash
just vault::put <path> <key>=<value>
```

Retrieve secrets:

```bash
just vault::get <path> <field>
```

## Remote Access

Once configured, you can access your cluster from anywhere:

```bash
# SSH access
ssh ssh.yourdomain.com

# Kubernetes API
kubectl --context yourpc-oidc get nodes

# Web interfaces
# Vault: https://vault.yourdomain.com
# Keycloak: https://auth.yourdomain.com
# Metabase: https://metabase.yourdomain.com
# Airflow: https://airflow.yourdomain.com
# JupyterHub: https://jupyter.yourdomain.com
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom Recipes

You can extend buun-stack with your own Just recipes and services:

1. Copy the example files:

   ```bash
   cp custom-example.just custom.just
   cp -r custom-example custom
   ```

2. Use the custom recipes:

   ```bash
   # Install reddit-rss
   just custom::reddit-rss::install

   # Install Miniflux feed reader
   just custom::miniflux::install
   ```

3. Create your own recipes:

Add new modules to the `custom/` directory following the same pattern as the examples. Each module should have its own `justfile` with install, uninstall, and other relevant recipes.

The `custom.just` file is automatically imported by the main Justfile if it exists, allowing you to maintain your custom workflows separately from the core stack.

## Troubleshooting

- Check logs: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>`
